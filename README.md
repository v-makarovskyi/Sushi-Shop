🖥 About the project

This project was developed using the MERN stack. The application implements full-fledged registration and user authorization using crypto-js and JWT.

🛒 It is possible to add/remove items to/from the cart, as well as adjust the number of items in the cart.

😎 The application also implements filtering products by category and sorting by price (up / down), as well as the date the product was added to the database.

The application consists of 6 pages:

1. Home
2. ProductList
3. Product
4. Cart
5. Register
6. Login

In the near future - the development of the profile page and the admin page.
